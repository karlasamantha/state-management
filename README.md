# State Management for React

Repo with the purpose of trying out different options for state management on react applications.

> To avoid conflicts with versions or dependencies, each subdirectory will have a fresh install of react, installed using CRA, and necessary packages.

For each option a TO DO app will be implemented, with the following capabilities:

- Add new entry
- Delete entry
- Edit entry

## Options

- [`useReducer`](./useReducer/)
- [Redux](./redux/)
- [Jotai](./jotai/)
- Mobx
